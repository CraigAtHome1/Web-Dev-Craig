    <h2 class="degree">This Is My Web Design and Development Portfolio Website</h2>

    <h3 class="slogan">"If you can imagine it, You can create it"</h3>

    <p>Hello, my name is Craig Johnson and I am currently studying web design and development at Lewis and Clark 
       Community College and I am a certified web designer. I worked for many years in retail management and I have 
       decided to make a career change. I am not only studying web development at school but I also spend my free time 
       studying and building projects on Udemy courses, as well as YouTube tutorials and I have also learned a lot from 
       w3schools online. I am still in the learning process but I have gained a strong understanding of HTML5 and CSS. 
       I am also learning JavaScript and PHP. I also have a strong understanding of Adobe Dreamweaver and WordPress. 
       The course I am also taking also covers graphic design and I can utilize programs such as Adobe Illustrator and 
       Adobe Photoshop. I started building this website on August 10th, 2020 and the website will be under constant 
       construction as I continue to build my online portfolio and work on my skills. Above you will find links to my 
       portfolio and resume, as well as my contact information.
    </p>
